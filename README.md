# valet_parking
Valet Parking system for cars using Data Structures Linked List and Hash Tables.

What you can do ? 

1- Add a car or park a car.

2 - Remove a car or unpark a car.

3 - Access a car using the car number.

Using Hash Tables will be efficient as compared to Linked list as accessing will be faster.
Though there might be collissions in Hash Tables but it could be solved using Chaining, Linear Probing,
Quadratic Probing, and Horner's Method. An efficient hash function implementation is key here.
